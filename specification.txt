Nutritional Optimization Machine (NOM) Program: Business Analysis Specification

Document Version: 1.2
Date: June 21, 2025

1. Introduction

This document outlines the business analysis and functional specifications for key components of the Nutritional Optimization Machine (NOM) program. It synthesizes the requirements and functionalities identified and developed during the initial phases of the project, particularly focusing on user onboarding, dietary restriction management, and foundational system architecture.

The purpose of this specification is to provide a common understanding for stakeholders, developers, and testers regarding the system's current capabilities, its intended user interactions, and the underlying business rules it enforces. This version also includes critical insights into the project's development context, technology choices, and common workflow practices, aiming to provide a comprehensive handover for any new developer or AI collaborator joining the project.

1.1. Project Vision

The overarching vision for the Nutritional Optimization Machine (NOM) program is to empower individuals and families to achieve their health and wellness goals through highly personalized, intelligent nutritional planning. We aim to move beyond generic diet advice by deeply understanding individual dietary needs, preferences, and medical restrictions, and then leveraging this data to optimize meal plans. Ultimately, NOM seeks to simplify healthy eating, make it more accessible, and foster collaborative dietary management within groups (families, teams, etc.).

2. Executive Summary

The NOM program aims to provide users with tools for personalized nutritional planning. The initial focus has been on establishing a robust user onboarding process that not only collects essential user information but also intelligently infers and manages dietary restrictions. A flexible questionnaire system, backed by a structured data model and secure API, forms the core of this initial user interaction. Furthermore, the system is designed to support the future integration of users into existing nutritional plans via invitation, laying the groundwork for collaborative features.

Current Development Status: The core user onboarding workflow (steps for personal details, health attributes, and restrictions for the primary user) is largely implemented on the frontend and integrated with the backend Person and Restriction services. The foundational data models and database migrations are in place. Work is actively progressing on iterating through additional participants for their individual restriction collection.

3. User Roles & Personas

The following primary user roles and system actors have been identified and considered in the developed functionalities:

*New User / Prospect*: An individual who has just registered or is in the process of initial account setup, requiring guidance through onboarding questions.

*Authenticated User*: A registered and logged-in user of the system who can interact with various features, including submitting personal information and participating in plans.

*Plan Administrator*: An authenticated user who creates and manages nutritional plans, and can invite others to join.

*Plan Member*: An authenticated user who participates in an existing nutritional plan.

*System*: An automated entity responsible for background processes, such as the automatic inference and recording of dietary restrictions based on user input, ensuring data integrity and auditability.

10. Development Context and Workflow

This section provides additional practical details about the project, intended to give a new collaborator immediate context for understanding the codebase and contributing effectively.

10.1. Current Project Status

    Onboarding Workflow (Core):

        Frontend (nom-ui): The OnboardingWorkflowComponent is the central orchestrator. PersonEditComponent and PersonHealthEditComponent are largely complete. The RestrictionEditComponent is implemented to handle various restriction types and the conditional allocation logic (plan-wide vs. specific individuals).

        Backend (Nom.Api, Nom.Orch, Nom.Data): Basic CRUD for Person and Restriction entities is supported. The PersonOrchestrationService handles the consolidated OnboardingCompleteRequest submission, mapping frontend DTOs to backend entities and persisting them. Core API endpoints for onboarding data submission and restriction reference data are in place.

    Authentication: Basic user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication are functional. Interceptors are set up for automatic token handling.

    Immediate Next Focus:

        Frontend: Completing the iterative flow for additional participants within the OnboardingWorkflowComponent, ensuring each participant can have their restrictions collected individually if applyIndividualPreferencesToEachPerson is true. This also means correctly managing the currentAdditionalParticipantIndex and re-rendering RestrictionEditComponent for each person.

        Backend: Refining the PersonOrchestrationService logic for handling multiple participants and their associated restrictions, including linking them to the correct PlanEntity (even if it's a new, implied plan for a single user).

10.2. Technology Stack Rationale

    Angular (Frontend): Chosen for its robust framework, opinionated structure, excellent tooling (Angular CLI), and strong support for large-scale enterprise applications. Standalone components are utilized for better modularity and tree-shaking.

    Angular Material (UI Library): Provides pre-built, accessible, and themable UI components, accelerating development and ensuring a consistent user experience.

    Tailwind CSS (Styling): A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development directly in HTML, reducing context switching and promoting consistency. It pairs well with Angular Material for custom layouts and fine-grained control.

    .NET Core (Backend): Selected for its high performance, cross-platform compatibility, extensive libraries, and strong developer ecosystem, making it suitable for scalable API development.

    Entity Framework Core (ORM): Simplifies database interactions by mapping C# objects to database tables, reducing boilerplate SQL code and improving developer productivity.

    PostgreSQL (Database): A powerful, open-source relational database known for its reliability, feature richness, and extensibility, ideal for a growing application.

    RxJS (Reactive Programming): Leveraged heavily in Angular for asynchronous operations (HTTP calls, event handling), promoting a more declarative and composable codebase.

10.3. Key Learnings & Debugging Tips

    AOT Compilation Sensitivity: Angular's AOT compiler is strict. Avoid complex JavaScript expressions (like regex literals or arrow functions within filter/map callbacks) directly in HTML template bindings. Move such logic into component TypeScript methods (e.g., getters or helper functions).

    Standalone Component Imports: Every standalone component must explicitly import all modules (even Angular Material ones like MatButtonModule, MatFormFieldModule) it directly uses in its @Component({ imports: [...] }) array. Missing imports are a common source of runtime errors or subtle AOT issues.

    Data Flow: Be mindful of Angular's unidirectional data flow. @Input receives data, @Output emits events. Avoid direct child manipulation; instead, parent components should react to emitted events and update their own state, which then flows back down.

    Backend API URLs: Always double-check apiUrl constants in frontend services (PersonService, RestrictionService). These frequently need adjustment between local development and deployment environments.

    Interceptor Order: The order of HTTP_INTERCEPTORS in app.config.ts matters. Ensure BearerInterceptor runs before ApiInteractionInterceptor if the latter depends on an authenticated request.

    Browser Caching: During frontend development, browser caching can sometimes cause issues. Clearing browser cache or using "Incognito/Private" mode can help. ng serve usually handles this well, but ng build --watch or specific browser setups might require manual intervention.

    Debugging (ng serve): Leverage browser developer tools for debugging Angular code. Set breakpoints in TypeScript and inspect component state. For backend issues, use the debugger in Visual Studio/VS Code.

10.4. Development Workflow & Practices

    Feature Branches: All new development should occur on dedicated feature branches, branched off main.

    Pull Requests (PRs): All code changes are submitted via PRs, requiring at least one reviewer.

    Code Reviews: Focus on consistency (naming, styling), adherence to architectural patterns, testability, and clarity.

    Unit Tests: While not extensively covered yet, the intention is to implement unit tests for services (using mocks) and isolated component logic.

    End-to-End Tests: Future consideration using tools like Cypress or Playwright for critical user flows.

    Linting: Pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines enforce linting rules (ESLint for TS, Stylelint for SCSS) to maintain code quality.

11. Suggested context for next Gemini Session
**Project Context: Nutritional Optimization Machine (NOM)** We are developing the **Nutritional Optimization Machine (NOM)**, a personalized nutritional planning application. Our core goal is comprehensive dietary restriction management and personalized meal planning. **1. Project Status & Immediate Focus:** * **Current Phase:** User onboarding workflow. * **Implemented:** Core person details, health attributes, and restrictions for the primary user are functional on the frontend and integrated with the backend. Authentication (registration, login, JWT) is also in place. * **Immediate Next Task:** Continuing development on the frontend's `OnboardingWorkflowComponent` to handle the iterative collection of dietary restrictions for **additional participants** (e.g., family members) within a single plan, including specific preferences per person. **2. Technology Stack:** * **Frontend (Angular `nom-ui`):** Angular (Standalone Components), Angular Material, Tailwind CSS, Reactive Forms, RxJS. * **Backend (.NET Solution):** .NET Core Web API (`Nom.Api`), Orchestration layer (`Nom.Orch`), Entity Framework Core (`Nom.Data`) for PostgreSQL. **3. Architectural Patterns & Key Components:** * **Domain-Driven Structure:** Code is organized by domain (e.g., `person/`, `restriction/`, `onboarding/`). * **Component Composition:** `OnboardingWorkflowComponent` orchestrates `PersonEditComponent`, `PersonHealthEditComponent`, and `RestrictionEditComponent`. * **Layered Backend:** Clear separation between API, business logic, and data access. * **Key Services:** `PersonService`, `RestrictionService` (frontend); `PersonOrchestrationService`, `RestrictionOrchestrationService` (backend). **4. Coding Conventions & Best Practices:** * **Naming:** `kebab-case` for file names/selectors, `PascalCase` for classes/enums. `camelCase` for variables/methods. * **Angular:** Prioritize AOT compilation. Standalone components *must* explicitly import all Angular Material modules they use. Use getters in TS for complex template logic (e.g., `filter` operations). * **Error Handling:** `NotificationService` for user feedback, HTTP interceptors (Bearer, API Interaction). * **Data Flow:** `@Input` down, `@Output` up. **5. Source Control:** * The full codebase is on GitHub: `https://github.com/danielhokanson/nutrition-optimization-machine/`. * Relative file paths within the repo follow a standard structure (e.g., `nom-ui/src/app/onboarding/components/onboarding-workflow/onboarding-workflow.component.ts`). **6. Recent Debugging Insights (for your context):** * Resolved "JIT compiler not available" errors by ensuring `BrowserAnimationsModule` and `HttpClientModule` are correctly imported in `app.config.ts` for AOT. * Resolved "Parser Error: Bindings cannot contain assignments" by moving `filter` logic from HTML templates into component getters (e.g., `filteredRestrictionsForCurrentPerson`). * Always perform a clean build (`npm install`, delete `.angular`, `dist`) for persistent issues. **Given this context, I need assistance with [specific task related to your "Immediate Next Task"].**
